title: About Me
---

My name is Michelle. I’m from Central Florida, and my family is from Puerto Rico and South Florida. I really like birds, whales and DSA.

I was on the 2018 Steering Committee of Orlando DSA, and organized the first Florida DSA Statewide Conference in March 2019. I am currently working on the bylaws committee for an official statewide DSA in Florida, which will be the first of its kind. I am active in the chapter’s Ecosocialism Working Group and have also done work with the Healthcare Working Group. 

My non-DSA work includes working on the successful campaign to mandate injury reporting for greyhound racing in Seminole County, Fla (an instrumental step in the eventual illegalization of greyhound racing statewide), as well as development and public relations for multiple non-profits and an online publication.
