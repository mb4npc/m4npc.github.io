## What I think needs to be done nationally

- Adjust to the new geographic and demographic shift in membership since 2016.
- Making radical and necessary changes to our organizing culture to include and appeal to marginalized groups.
- Focus on developing new chapters, as well as providing more support for organizing committees, and at-large me-mbers. 
- Expand and decentralize national staff.
- Radical transparency
- Expanding disaster relief networks and providing greater support for communities defending themselves from a more hostile climate and the hightened exploitation from disaster capitalists. 
- A focus on families and children's education.
- A greater focus on inclusivity and accomodations for families of all types.
- Ecosocialism as a foundationial ideology of the DSA.
- Nationalization of energy infrastructure.
