- Recognizing diversity in organizing across different geographical and political climates
    - Population density, jurisdiction size for locals and transportation infrastructure all create a variety of organizing needs - the same tactics wonâ€™t necessarily work for different chapters. The tactics and campaigns we use are affected by how people in our area get to work, the working and housing conditions they exist under, the weather, the demographics of an area, and countless other factors. We must recognize these differences and embrace them in order to organize effectively nationwide. 
- Aggressive bottom-up organizing
    - These are more than just words - all priorities, tactics and campaigns must be initiated and organized on a local level. National should serve as a support system and a network to coordinate and tie together projects nationwide. National priorities should be strategic and broad enough to allow for local chapters to implement them in a way that makes sense for their specific situations.
    - National should never dictate to a chapter - explicitly or implicitly - what the details of their actions should be and instead should listen to local struggles and priorities and work with chapters to organize appropriate actions. 
- Expand and decentralize national staff.
    - Currently, national staff is overworked with job descriptions that encompass multiple different roles. To function efficiently and without overworking them, DSA needs more paid staff and a restructuring of roles and positions. 
    - A staff based in an urban center creates some unintentional biases, a more decentralized staff more completely represents the organization. This means as much staff as possible working remotely and potentially moving National offices to a different, more representative location.
- Radical transparency
    - The NPC and all of National DSA should work to make processes as transparent as possible, with meeting recordings, minutes, and agendas available and easily accessible to membership. 
- Disaster relief networks and support
    - Particularly in our rapidly changing climate, disaster relief and emergency preparedness are an increasingly vital component of organizing and protecting our membership and communities. DSA should provide resources to chapters looking to start a disaster relief program, as well as facilitate the sharing of resources, money, and labor after a disaster. DSA should recognize the seriousness of disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, severe winter storms and tornadoes and recognize the hardships affected locals might experience. DSA should also have a national fund for disasters so membership is able to donate and know the money is going to affected chapters who are working in disaster recovery.
- A focus on families and children's education
    - The formation of a formalized childcare program at all national events, conferences and conventions, as well as for national staff. 
    - Resources and guides for formalized childcare that all chapters can use, that includes information on background checks, certifications, age appropriate entertainment,childproofing and safety practices.
    - Creation of resources for socialist education programs for children for events that focus on educating and engaging children with socialism in an age appropriate manner.
- A greater focus on inclusivity and accomodations for families of all types.
- Ecosocialism as a foundationial ideology of the DSA
    - Climate change is here and no effective work towards building socialism can be done without consideration of environmental impacts and issues. Every single national priority and campaign MUST include ecosocialist principles in order to be lasting and effective. Climate change is impacting and will continue to impact the working class significantly more than the ruling class and will continue to apply greater stress to people of color, people in the Global South, and our poorest comrades. Therefore, ecosocialism can not be separated from any other priority or working group and no other work can be separated from it. 
    - DSA should prioritize campaigns
- To nationalize the energy infrastructure
        - To address unsustainable, unjust, and inefficient food systems
        - To recognize and combat instances of environmental racism
        - Which use realistic and science based models of climate change to inform discussion
- DSA is failing at including and appealing to marginalized groups.
    - Address the needs of marginalized groups and not what we think their needs are. This means that actions and campaigns which largely impact a certain marginalized group should be led by members of that group in all cases. If nobody is available to lead the campaign from the affected communities, then work should halt until this is possible.
    - DSA should actively work to make spaces inclusive to members of marginalized groups. This might include considering meeting locations, nongendered bathrooms, reducing interactions with law enforcement, accessibility and accommodations for members with disabilities and organizational culture.
    - We should center the voices of marginalized groups in our organizing without also expecting a disproportionate amount of physical and mental labor.
